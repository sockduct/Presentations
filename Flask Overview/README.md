# Presentation - Flask Overview
## Created as a talk for [MUG](http://www.mug.org) - December 11, 2018

## Synopsis
Presentation for the MUG Detroit metro area user group on using Flask, a Python Micro Web Framework.  The talk begins by positioning it within the web ecosystem and briefly comparing it to Django.  Next we'll dive into building a web application using Flask.  Starting simple we'll proceed to introduce templates, forms, user sessions, and finish up with error handling.  We'll conclude with next steps and interesting adjacent areas.

## Code
[Here](../../../../flaskapp) is the repo with the code used during the talk.
