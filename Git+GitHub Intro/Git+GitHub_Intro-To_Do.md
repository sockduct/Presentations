# Git+GitHub Intro Preso - Possible Improvements

Thoughts after presenting to MUG on 9/13/2016:
* Need diagram showing GitHub fork versus git clone and flow between GitHub repos and Git repos
* Clearly define GitHub fork and Git clone
* Explain why you fork and clone (because you don't have commit rights to original GitHub repo so need to do this for PR)
* Would be nice to include some references comparing other CVS like cvs, svn, et. al.
* Consider more examples of branching and clarifying differences between forks, clones and branches
* Use cases would be helpful, e.g.:
  * Using for "dot files" - keep all your configuration files in the cloud and synchronized across systems
  * Using for configuration management - keeping configuration templates and system in the cloud to facilitate collaboration
  * Using for script management (similar to above)
