# Presentation - Selenium, Web Automation

## Created as a talk for [MUG](http://www.mug.org) - January 11, 2022

## Synopsis
Presentation for the MUG Detroit metro area user group on the Selenium Web Automation Framework.  This talk presents a brief history of Selenium, what it is, what is supports, and my use case for it.  I then develop my use case - the driver, the approach, and how I built out a solution using Selenium.
