# Presentations on IPv6
## Created as talks for [MUG](http://www.mug.org) - Various dates, see below

## Synopsis
Presentations for the MUG Detroit metro area user group on many different fascets of IPv6 - the why, industry landscape, technical overview, getting started/piloting, monitoring deployment progress.  IPv6 has been an interesting journey for me.  I really started digging into it going into 2011 and spent 5 years becoming a SME and doing some interesting global deployments.  I've done at least a couple dozen presentations to user groups, conferences, multi-nationals, and for training.  These four cover a lot of what I spent time on.  Hope you find them useful.
