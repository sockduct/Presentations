# Multi-process server
#
# Caveat - won't work in interactive session, must run from file
# * Also, must use __name__ == '__main__'...
# * This is a limitation of multiprocessing module
# * Believe because of IPC/Pickling
#
# Created for Concurrent Python presentation
#
# Based on examples/code from David Beazley including following:
# * Fear and Awaiting in Async (Screencast)
